# GameCollector

GameCollector is a Laravel-based web app that lets you store information about your video game collection.

# Features

 * Uses [Laravel Nova](https://nova.laravel.com) for a robust front-end
 * Has lots of fields useful for collectors and sellers, including:
   * When and where you bought an item and how much it cost you.
   * Selling fields such as where you sold it, for how much, and how much you listed it for.
   * The condition of the item
   * Metadata field so you can add arbitrary information such as publisher, serial numbers, CD keys etc.
   * Tags for marking things as on your wishlist, reproduction, games you've played / are playing
 * Upload images for each item so you can see what you have, what condition it's in, and so on. Also great for preserving game manuals, insets and such.
 * Create collections. They can be as broad as "All my Pok√©mon Games", or as specific as "Games bought at a garage sale on June 29th 2019"
 * Search to quickly find a game, tag, note or almost anything else about the game.
 * Comes with Laravel Cashier support, so you can plug in your own Stripe details.
