# GameCollector

GameCollector is a Laravel-based web app that lets you store information about your video game collection.

# Features

 * Uses [Laravel Nova](https://nova.laravel.com) for a robust front-end
 * Has lots of fields useful for collectors and sellers, including:
   * When and where you bought an item and how much it cost you.
   * The condition of the item
   * Metadata field so you can add arbitrary information such as publisher, serial numbers, CD keys etc.
   * Tags for marking things as on your wishlist, reproduction, games you've played / are playing
 * Upload images for each item so you can see what you have, what condition it's in, and so on. Also great for preserving game manuals, insets and such.
 * Create collections. They can be as broad as "All my Pok√©mon Games", or as specific as "Games bought at a garage sale on June 29th 2019"
 * Search to quickly find a game, tag, note or almost anything else about the game.

# Requirements

 * PHP 7.2
 * MySQL 5.7.8 or later (for JSON support)
 * **A valid Laravel Nova 2.0 license**
 * `intl` PHP extension for currency

# Installation

 * Set up your webserver of choice.
 * Create a new database in MySQL.
 * Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
 * Edit `.env` and set your options as necessary.
 * Run `composer install` and provide your Laravel Nova login details.
 * Run `php artisan migrate --seed`
 * Use `php artisan tinker` to create a new user.
 * Go to `/collection` on your webserver to get started (e.g. http://localhost/gamecollector/collection)
